There are multiple ways in which you can show your support for our project and help us make it a reality!

You can become a sponsor by offering your products, venues and overall material assistance to help us on the days of MEU Athens.

You can also become a partner by providing us with invaluable advice and expertise which will greatly benefit us in effectively organising our event. Either way, your products, services and brand will have a pan-European reach as we expect to attract participants from all over Europe.

In BETA Greece we believe that all contributions- both big and small- are equally valuable, simply because they all constitute building blocks of a larger project; our flagship MEU Athens simulation.

We hope we can count on your help and support not only to ensure that this project becomes a reality but most importantly to make it one of the most memorable MEUs, an importantly as a platform to educate todayâ€™s youth about affairs of the European Union.

We encourage you to join us in this collective community effort to educate, engage and empower our youth.

For more information, please get in-touch with the President of BETA Greece, Ms. Yogambigai Rajendra: <mailto:yogam1991@gmail.com>
